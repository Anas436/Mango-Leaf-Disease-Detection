While its luscious taste is loved globally, mango trees are often subjected to various diseases that can adversely affect fruit yield. Diseases like 'Anthracnose', 'Bacterial Canker', 'Die Back', and 'Powdery Mildew' are some of the common diseases that affect mango leaves.</p>\n","\n","<p style=\"font-size:20px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em\">Early detection of these diseases can aid in proper management and ensure high fruit yield. With advancements in technology, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify these diseases in their early stages can be immensely helpful. This notebook attempts to harness the power of CNNs for mango leaf disease detection and classification.</p>\n","\n","<p style=\"font-size:20px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em\">In this analysis, we'll be focusing on detecting the following diseases based on mango leaf images: 'Anthracnose', 'Bacterial Canker', 'Die Back', 'Gall Midge', 'Healthy', 'Powdary Mildew', and 'Scooty Mould'.</p>\n","</div>\n","\n","# ‚ùóAuthor's Note:\n","<div style=\"background-color:#d4f1f4; padding: 20px;\">\n","<p style=\"font-size:20px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em\">Make sure to run the cells from top to bottom with a GPU accelerator.
